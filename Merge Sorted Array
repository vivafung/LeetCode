Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

Note:
You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. 
The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.

class Solution 
{
    public:
    void merge(int A[], int m, int B[], int n) 
    {
        int count=m+n-1;
        m--; n--;
        while (m>=0 && n>=0){
            //if A[m]>B[n], then A[m--], if not, then B[n--]
            A[count--] = A[m]>B[n]? A[m--]:B[n--];
        }
        while (n>=0){ A[count--] = B[n--];}
    }
};
